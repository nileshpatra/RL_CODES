# RL_CODES
This repository contains my reinforcement learning codes that I have implemented.
As of now they include these RL algorithms(first three are specific to bandits problem): 
They also include the log plots of the value they approach over time. 
- ```epsilon greedy ```
- ``` optimistic value```
- ``` UCB1```
