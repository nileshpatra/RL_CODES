# RL_CODES
This repository contains my reinforcement learning codes that I have implemented.
As of now they include these RL algorithms(first three are specific to bandits problem): 
They also include the log plots of the value they approach over time. 
- ```epsilon greedy ```<br>
      result : ( the algo approaches most profitable bandit)<br>

- ``` optimistic initial  value```
- ``` UCB1```<br>
      result : ( the algo approaches most profitable bandit and is more accurate than first two algos) <br>
